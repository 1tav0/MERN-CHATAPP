In computer science, rendering refers to the process of generating an image from a 
model by means of computer programs. It is used to create 2D and 3D computer graphics 
for use in various media, such as films, television programs, and video games. 
In web development, rendering refers to the process of generating the HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript code that is sent to the browser to be displayed as a web page. When a user 
interacts with a web page, the browser sends a request to the server for the updated page, 
which is then rendered and displayed in the browser.
